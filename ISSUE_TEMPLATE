Before logging a new issue please make sure to:
1) Read the [FAQ](https://github.com/Microsoft/AL/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)
2) Search if there is an existing issue for what you want to log. If it's closed you can reopen it and add your comments.
3) Use the latest Developer Preview release both the server part and the AL Language extension in VS Code (listed on the [repository home page](https://github.com/Microsoft/AL))
4) If you're not using the latest released version (or are using a private build drop that is newer) please provide the version number in the issue

To help us reproduce the issue and find the root please try to:
A) Attach a minimal set of AL code that causes the issue
B) If the error occurs on the server - copy/paste the server stack trace from the Event Viewer
